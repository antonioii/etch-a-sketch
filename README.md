##Notes    

* Due the lack of compatibility, I prefered to use the "select tag" for the
resize button, instead the "range input type".   

* The first idea was to use squares in order to compose the canvas, but using
rectangles had a more interesting final design in my opinion. To change it 
back to squares, we could just assign a fix value to the 'canvasboard' width
and height.
