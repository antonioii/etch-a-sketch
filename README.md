# Etch-a-sketch


My implementation of an Etch a Sketch (html, css, js) for The Odin Project.   

---

## Yet to be done:

1- take off the custom cursor icon,  
2- further user explanation about rainbow buttons,   
3- further user explanation about interrogation buttons,  
4- complete the footer with copyright and about the odin project/github,   
5- correct eraser activation/deactivation function,  
6- better tool icons reponsivity when clicked (UX matters),

##Notes    

* Due the lack of compatibility, I prefered to use the "select tag" for the
resize button, instead the "range input type".   

* The first idea was to use squares in order to compose the canvas, but using
rectangles had a more interesting final design in my opinion. To change it 
back to squares, we could just assign a fix value to the 'canvasboard' width
and height.
